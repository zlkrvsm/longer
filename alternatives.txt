# Package longitudinalData, by Christophe Genolini and collaborators
Strong imputation function.
Plots trajectories and mean trajectories (even in 3d).
qualityCriterion function.

Documentation has a lot of typos, which is fixable. Package 
seems outdated.

Unclear to me who the target audience for this package is. Clearly 
technical, focused on k-means and other clustering techniques.

# Package brolgar, by Nicholas Tierney, Di Cook and Tania Prvan.

Uses tsibble. Tidyverse oriented.

Sampling function! sample_n_keys() and sample_frac_keys().
I guess everyone has the same problem. However, these functions
require the tsibble, which I would like to avoid. I want to
make it agnostic to the class, so it works on data.frames and
data.tables as well as tsibbles.

Graphical helpers, facet_sample(), interesting. Allows you to
create multiple panels in ggplot facets with a few individuals
in each. Specialized, I am not so interested in it.

Features! I had forgot about those from fabletools and feasts.
They provide good helpers for individual level summaries of means,
trajectories, etc. I do want to implement something like this,
but again, agnostic!

n_obs() and n_keys() are kind of useless because data.table
and base already provide good enough functions for that. uniqueN()
comes to mind, for example.

Thing about features is that they require setup, and are already
easily accesible in data.table and ggplot through grouped summaries,
so I do not see much of an advantage. I do see a win in providing
easy access to specific "feature combos", like the 5-number summary
and the feat_monotonic function for numeric trajectories, but 
it is still missing Proportions-over and a way to feature binomial or
multinomial "trajectories".

Interesting stratify_keys function. Easy way to split the data by
some criterion. Could be implemented in a generic form for data.frames.

# Package 'longitudinal' by Rainer Opgen-Rhein and Korbinian Strimmer.
Seems to be focused on genetics. Implements a longitudinal data stru-
cture similar to tsibble. Has a longitudinal utils suite of functions
which is worth cribbing, to check for repeated observation in time,
whether observations are equally spaced, and for combining and con-
densing longitudinal objects. 

It looks great, but I think some of this 'longitudinal' class is 
unnecessary overhead on data.frames. I like the checking functions,
but I am not convinced we need a special class a la tsibble or 
longitudinal objects.

Moreover, I am doing this mostly to learn the ropes, and hopefully 
once I feel a little more comfortable, I can start contributing
on something like brolgar or data.table itself.

Many longitudinal packages (found an extra one, called lgtdl) also 
deal with the imputation of data in gaps between observations a
lot, which is understandable, so my package could also deal with
that. I think imputation is a bit of misnomer though, because 
ultimately it is about the broader process of creating longitudinal 
variables, rather than dataset specific ways of treating missing
that in between observations.
